"""Task-focused modules for mixed signed primitive benchmarking.

This package keeps each concern in a separate file:
- constants: benchmark defaults and operator sets
- programs: source generation for builtin/native/interpret modes
- runners: isolated execution/measurement per backend
- io_utils: result persistence helpers
- cli: argument parsing + orchestration
