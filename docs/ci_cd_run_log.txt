   - Result: 12/12 tests passed, 0 failed
   - Extra correctness pass:
     - python3 tests/phase5/primitives/crosslang_native_primitives_tests.py
     - Result: pass (int + float validation outputs generated under bench/results/primitives/)

2) GitHub workflow rerun/dispatch
   - CI (workflow_dispatch): run 22268014651 -> success
   - Workflow Lint (rerun): run 22267929371 -> success
   - Security (CodeQL) (rerun): run 22267929376 -> success

3) Previous push-based green set (reference)
   - CI: run 22267929377 -> success
   - Workflow Lint: run 22267929371 -> success
   - Security (CodeQL): run 22267929376 -> success

Execution notes
- Workflow Lint and Security (CodeQL) do not expose workflow_dispatch in current YAML;
  rerun was executed with `gh run rerun <run_id>`.
- dependency-review workflow is PR-triggered only; no push/manual run in this branch-only pass.
- Remote default branch is `main`, but active delivery/integration branch for this cycle is `master`.

Why this cycle was executed
- User requested full CI/CD re-run gate before merge/finalization.
- Merge gate policy used here: no integration finalization unless local suite + GitHub CI/CD are fully green.
